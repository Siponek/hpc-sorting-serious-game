note bottom of SEQ
  **Sequential Execution**
  * One player sorts all cards
  * No parallelism
  * Baseline for comparison
end note

note bottom of OMP
  **OpenMP Shared Memory**
  * Multiple players collaborate
  * Shared container = shared memory
  * Private buffers = thread-local storage
end note
